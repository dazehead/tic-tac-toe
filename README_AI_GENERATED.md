I started off asking it to create a terminal tic-tac-toe game using python. It perfomred this but it was just an example
![1st input](https://github.com/dazehead/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/chatGPT_images/1st_input.png)

I noticed the code was only in functions and wanted to implement classes

I decided to tell it to write it for me since it was just giving me examples
![3rd input](3rd_input.png)

after running I realized it only coded for 1 player and the only player would input for both sybols I asked it to make this 2 player
![4th input](4th_input.png)

it responded with the full code but at the bottom it looked like some was cutoff I then asked the AI if there was a limit on how much it could print and I found out YES there was from here on I decided to ask more specific questions

After figuring out that it has a limit I asked it to only print off the code that was changed and it did just that
![6th input](6th_input.png)

I realized after testing the program that even if you win or tie the game just keeps going on. I asked how to stop the program from running
![7th input](7th_input.png)

After testing the program I realized it would ask if they wanted to keep playing every turn and I wanted to only make it asks that question to terminate the program after a game has won or tied
