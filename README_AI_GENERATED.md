# 1st imput
## I started off asking it to create a terminal tic-tac-toe game using python. It performed this but it was just an example

# 2nd input
## I noticed the code was only in functions and wanted to implement classes

# 3rd Input
## I decided to tell it to write it for me since it was just giving me examples

# 4rd Input
## After running I realized it only coded for 1 player and the only player would input for both symbols I asked it to make this 2 player

# 5th Input
##it responded with the full code but at the bottom it looked like some was cutoff I then asked the AI if there was a limit on how much it could print and I found out YES there was a limit on character it could print. From here on I decided to ask more specific questions

# 6th Input
## After figuring out that it has a limit I asked it to only print off the code that was changed and it did just that

# 7th Input
## I realized after testing the program that even if you win or tie the game just keeps going on. I asked how to stop the program from running

# 8th Input
## After testing the program I realized it would ask if they wanted to keep playing every turn and I wanted to only make it ask that question to terminate the program after a game has won or tied
